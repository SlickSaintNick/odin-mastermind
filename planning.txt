Spec:
- command line
- 12 turns
- Human codebreaker vs computer code setter
- First build with:
    - Computer randomly selects
    - Human player guesses
    - Computer gives feedback
- Second, refactor:
    - Human player chooses to be codebreaker or code setter.
    - Computer can guess colors following its own strategy.

PSEUDOCODE (human player vs. computer)
Init random computer sequence of 4 colours
Init empty board (2D array 12 * 8)
While playing:
    12 times:
        Display stats
        Display board
        Prompt for input (they input using numbers).
            Quit if 'exit'
        Check player input against correct sequence
        If correct
            Player wins
                Update stats to reflect win
                Update board to reflect win
                Display new stats
                Display winning board (reveal combination)
                Prompt for new game
        Else
            Calculate feedback (black and white pegs)
            Update board for this turn.
    End loop
    Computer wins
        Update stats
End loop
